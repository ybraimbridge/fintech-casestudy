# PAPERLESS CURRENCY 1

## Overview and Origin
---
The Digitation of currency has become a necessary step into the future money with the advancement of blockchain, stable coins and cryptocurrency. Major players like bitcoin and Ethereum have pushed Central banks and it's respective countries to look into the possiblities of CBDC's. CBDC stands for central bank digital currency. The purpose of a CBDC would be add regulation to a loosey governed sector while answering the needs of today's average consumer.

* State Street Corporation

* State Street has been incorporated since 1792

* State Street received it's bank charter from John Hancock

* State street was created original as one of the first banking institutions for the United States. It's core practices were surrounded around financial transactions with England as well as allowing pilgrims to begin to create their own financial imprint.

* State street is mainly funded through its assets under management. It's investment management arm is the catalyst to all of its other financials holdings.


## Business Activities
---
* State Street has an array of financial problems to tackle. With respect to this report, State Street is pushing the digitization of currency within the Central Banking sector. State street argues that physical currency is a thing of the past and consumers have spoken. Consumers want less regulation on financial transactions and the ability to tie their currency to the central banks direct assets versus a physical currency backed by a commodity.

* State street's market for the CBDC's starts with the emerging digtal currency consumer. Consumers currently doing financial transactions with cryptocurrency, block chain and money transfer intruments. Their market then branches to the entire financial world as CBDC's are being designed to take the place of money

* State Street offers the ability enter the CBDC's as a strong investor and an a hybrid model of a CBDC's in which, the commerical bank handles all customer onboarding and future infastructure and the central bank maintains a central ledger and manages the totality of regulation.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)


## Landscape
---
* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years? Endowment investing is a new trend where investors have seen returns up 30% with a year period. Companies within the domain are using AI to filter through big data to uncover investment trends and possible next steps. Actvely Advising clients on a consistent basis vs the outdated practice of quartely or semi annually advising has become a new trend due to all the major market shifts that have occurred due to Covid-19 and Cryptocurrencies.

* JP Morgan, Citibank,BlackRock, Bank of New York, Wells Fargo,UBS , Brown Brothers harriman are some of State Street major players.


## Results

* Although , State Street has not yet created or backed a CBDC the benefits for this to become a investable assest are limitless. CBDC'S have the power to put a end to loans to consumers backed by insurances and instead will be backed by the digital value held at the bank. CBDC's would mean the end of physical money. The purchase of physical money would be obsolete.Banks would lose that over head cost including the necessity for ATMS and most teller related transactions. Banks could become Fully automated to the public. Regulation would be simplfied as the transactions could be monitored by AI and the digital funds could always be tracked. CBDC's would effectively take alot of the human error out of handling finance.

*State Street is a leading player in the push for global CBDC's. As such, State street will have early opportunties to aid in the funding and creation of CBDC's around the world. As of 2021 105 countries are exploring the creation of a CBDC.

## Recommendations
---
* State Street is already ahead of the curve as they have predicted physical money end is near. My recommendation would be to bolster their tech capabilities to become a major player in the hybrid CBDC space. State street will need to prove the banking capabilities to move exclusively to digital and paperless. State street should invest heavily in the AI necessary to improve their regulatory practices. Also, coaching their client base away from old practices and implementing practices that deal less with phsyical money and more with the digital. I believe this becomes a race for their major competitors. The first Major bank to knock off the socks of the FED become a major partner in the space.
